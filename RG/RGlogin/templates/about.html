            <p>
                Hello, this is Michael Jung. I'm a junior CS major at Emory University, 
                and I am from Seoul, South Korea. I really like playing RPG games, especially 
                Roguelikes, but I also enjoy playing League of Legends from time to time. 
                Being passionate about game development, I will try my best to contribute 
                my time and energy to this wonderful and challenging project so that you can 
                have a better gaming environment!
            </p>

            <p>
                Hello, my name is Hunter Grimes. I'm a senior graduating with a BS in CS 
                this spring. When I'm not doing schoolwork, I spend my time climbing up 
                the ranked ladder in League of Legends. My hope is to bring my hard-won 
                expertise in League of Legends to the average player through Rabadon's Grimoire. 
                We hope our time and passion for this project will pay off for each and every 
                one of you. See you on the rift!

                Hi, I'm Erik Tkachenko. I am a junior at Emory University from St. Louis, MO, 
                and I am studying Computer Science. I love strategy games, including chess, 
                poker, and video games (but I am horrible at League). Games are my passion and 
                I am happy to be part of a project which makes improving and honing your skills 
                more accessible!
            </p>

            <p>
                My name is Tarun Hoskere. I am currently studying Computer Science in my fourth 
                year at Emory University. As an avid video game player, I found interest in 
                Rabadon’s Grimoire. I am always looking for ways to improve my game skills. 
                Working on this project allowed me to dive deeper into an interesting game and 
                develop skills for my future career as a software engineer.

            <p>
                I am Fernando Nunez. I come from Honduras and am in my fourth year as an Emory 
                Computer Science Major. I joined the team based on my recent interest in 
                multiplayer games since I can play them without any issues due to having access 
                to high-speed internet. I enjoy improving the way I play games to ensure a 
                better experience. Though I plan to focus careerwise on the Cybersecurity aspect 
                of Computer Science, I plan to continue working on games and game-related 
                projects as a hobby.
