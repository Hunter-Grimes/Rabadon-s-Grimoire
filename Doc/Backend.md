This file should be very self explanatory, if an error occurs with accessing the Riot API it will return an error code, this file in turn will return what the error code means.
This means that unless a change occurs with the Riot API this file should probably remain unchanged as long as everything is up to date.
For an explanation on what each error code means and some common reasons for it visit the [Riot Documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal#web-apis_response-codes).
