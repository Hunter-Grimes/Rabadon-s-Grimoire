# Rabadon's Grimore: How to Use
## Requirements 
Rabadon's Grimore is a League of Legends companion app meant for improving the way you play the game as such there is a few requirements on how to use our application.
1. **League of Legends must be running before opening the App**
Our App is very convenient for the user and does not need you to input your Riot ID manually to get your information, getting it directly from the League of Legends app. Due to this the App won't open if it does not detect League running beforehand.
2. **User must have played a few games of League of Legends** 
This app uses your game data to improve the way you play, as such it can't do anything if you are new to the game, have no game data, and still need to find your playstyle. Come back once you have played a few games and gotten a rank this season, don't worry we will wait.
